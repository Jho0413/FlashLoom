# FlashLoom

FlashLoom is a web application that follows the **Software as a Service (Saas)** model, allowing users to summarize and test their understanding on anything by generating flashcards using AI from different input sources:
- Text prompts
- YouTube URLS (extracting key points from videos)
- PDF files (summarising content from files)

This web application has been deployed using **Vercel** and can be accessed here: https://flash-loom.vercel.app/. The Flask application has been deployed using **Heroku**.
